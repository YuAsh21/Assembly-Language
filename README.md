The 8051 Intel microcontroller proves highly efficient for various tasks, ranging from simple LED delay timing to complex alarm systems.
In the assignment, assembly language, a low-level programming language, was utilized to program the microcontroller. Due to their distant syntax from human language,
low-level languages pose greater complexity in comprehension. The assignment involved the creation and implementation of an 8051-based queuing system.
This system is capable of transmitting service and queue numbers to the internet upon pressing either the service or queue button.
Additionally, it displays the service and queue numbers on a dual 7-segment LED display, with the buzzer emitting a sound each time the service number changes.
